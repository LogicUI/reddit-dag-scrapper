lneu8rw,"My biggest tip - **THERE IS NO RIGHT (OR WRONG) WAY TO JOURNAL.** 

Most hobbies, even creative ones, have methods that are typically taught and practiced and treated as 'standard'. Journaling, however, isn't like that. Because it is purely about self expression, you'd be hard pressed to find a way to do it 'wrong'. 

**There are truly no rules or external standards you need to follow.** It is entirely for you and entirely subjective. Whether it isn't or isn't working for you is determined by *what* exactly you want to get out of it and if your current way of journaling is in alignment with that.

**Some of you will love hearing that. But some of you will feel like you now have TOO many options, and dont know where to start.**

Don't fret! **A good first step can be to take inspiration from others and set rules for yourself to accomplish a specific goal** (e.g. no ripping out pages if you struggle to be perfectionistic, choosing to end your entry on a positive note if you know you tend to spiral). But fundamentally, these rules aren't fixed. **Sometimes boundaries inspire creativity, but at the end of the day, those boundaries aren't universally applicable nor do they need to be followed dogmatically.** They exist to serve you and can be discarded when they no longer do so. 

**This is a creative practice, not meant for public consumption or critiquing. It can be whatever you want it to be!**

Following on from this, my second biggest tip - **ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE FLEXIBLE. One type of journaling has rarely worked for me forever.** 

I've had a journal just for my thoughts and feelings. Then I moved to typing in work docs. Then journaling in a self care app. Then back to notebooks again, but this time as one part of a common place journal with lots of other kinds of entries. 

I've done art journals, junk journals, collage. I've written in prose, bullet points lists, and poetry! 

**Each kind of journaling has served me at a different point in my life - emotionally and practically. If I expected my journaling practice to stay exactly the same, even as my needs changed, then I would have just stopped entirely** (which is okay too! I've done that as well, for a time). 

What you need from your journaling practice might vary and change. So might your specific *why*. **Allowing it to be flexible and not feeling any shame about it will allow your journalling to shape shift with your needs and life** and support you through whatever you're going through.

Maybe before you had time to write pages and pages, but now with a new job/kids/responsibility/life change/health issue, you can only manage bullet points. 

That's okay! 

Maybe you had some intense emotions to process and wrote a lot of heavy, profound things, but you got past that and all you want to do now is write abut your favorite tv show, or what you did with your day. 

That's okay! 

Maybe you used to journal every day, and you were always bursting with things to say, but now you only pick up your journal once in a while, when you have a memory or thought to preserve. Or maybe you only used to write when you had something to say, and now you do it every day because you just like the feeling of pen on paper. 

That's okay, too!",flowers_and_fire,2024-09-16 22:15:07,85,https://reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/1fhr2y4/megathread_getting_started_with_journaling/lneu8rw/,journaling,t3_1fhr2y4,False,[Megathread] Getting Started with Journaling!,8b6c44762679ee096619fc6f283d14e46d0bf05b8c28f441b81de2c664831f87,ba68eb7135b949b5d7c27cb76ed348b07d7cd2ac805a76f2e662f52163743241,Y,"Feeling overwhelmed by too many options and not knowing where to start, Struggling with perfectionism (e.g., ripping out pages), Tendency to spiral into negative thoughts without structure, Difficulty maintaining a consistent journaling practice as needs change, Shame or guilt about changing journaling methods or frequency","Freedom to journal without rules or external standards, Flexibility to adapt journaling to personal needs and life changes, Ability to use journaling for self-expression in diverse ways (e.g., art, prose, bullet points), Journaling as a tool for emotional and practical support, No pressure to conform to a fixed method or frequency","Find a starting point for journaling when feeling overwhelmed by options, Create personal rules or structures to support specific goals (e.g., avoiding perfectionism, ending on a positive note), Adapt journaling methods to changing emotional or practical needs, Use journaling as a flexible tool for self-care and expression, Overcome guilt or shame about changing journaling habits","Flexibility in journaling, Personalization, Self-expression, Adaptability to life changes, Overcoming perfectionism, Emotional processing, Journaling methods (e.g., art, bullet points, prose), Non-judgmental practice",0.9,"Customizable Journaling Templates: Offer a variety of templates (e.g., free-form, bullet points, art/collage, poetry) that users can switch between based on their current needs.

_""How to stay consistent?""_

* The basic strategies from the most frequently recommended book about building habits, Atomic Habits, work well for this. _Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying._ Examples of their implementations:
  * _Set visual cues_ (e.g. keep your notebook and/or your dedicated journaling pen(s) in a very visible place, as a reminder to journal, and/or bring your journal with you in your bag).
  * _Set a doable & enjoyable min. quota_ (""minimum enjoyable action""; e.g. ""journal 1+ (F+T) sentence"" where F+T are feelings & thoughts OR 5min OR 1 page, etc.) that you keep the same at all times, to accommodate for tough days.
  * _Give yourself additional reasons to open your journal every day_ (e.g. keep your habit trackers and/or your daily todo/DONE list/Daily Log and/or Monthly Log there). 
  * _Habit stacking_ is great, if possible (journal just before/after your already solid habit).
  * Use a comfy notebook that you like (before buying it: _""Do I want to write in it?"")_ & pen that you like, but they must be affordable enough to not be overwhelming, cheap enough for you to not worry about 'wasting them.' E.g. lots of people use composition notebooks for journaling (cheap, especially on a school sale; good paper; sturdy enough) or their local versions of them or uni notebooks, and find them to be freeing.
  * _Figure out & remember your Why's for journaling_ (e.g. how it can help you act by your core values / move toward your goals / tackle your current big challenges; some people journal 'just for fun').
  * Make an effort to find / focus on _what's enjoyable_ in your journaling practice.
  * Do Negative Visualization (remind yourself of the negative consequences / costs of not journaling on that particular day).
* Use this extended version of Rubber Ducking technique to find solutions that are specific to your brain & circumstances: (1) Your problem (2) What's not working (3) Why isn't it working (4) What you've tried (5) What you haven't tried yet (6) What you want to have happen.",hellowings,2024-09-16 15:11:43,29,https://reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/1fhr2y4/megathread_getting_started_with_journaling/lndjgf9/,journaling,t3_1fhr2y4,False,[Megathread] Getting Started with Journaling!,8b6c44762679ee096619fc6f283d14e46d0bf05b8c28f441b81de2c664831f87,512b35240a21176ee220c4741b2ac1333e99d4b67102505259d77beccbcd39a4,Y,"Difficulty staying consistent with journaling, Overwhelm when starting a new notebook, Concerns about 'ugly' vs 'aesthetic' journals, Gender-related doubts about journaling (e.g., 'Is journaling for men?'), Mistakes beginners make that could be avoided, Finding the right notebook type (blank, lined, grid, dotted), Fear of someone else reading the journal, Cost concerns (e.g., 'cheap journaling')","Journaling helps in hard times (emotional support), Self-knowledge through free writing, Inspiration from Olympic athletes' journaling practices, Habit formation strategies (e.g., Atomic Habits techniques), Enjoyment and fun in journaling, Tracking progress (e.g., habit trackers, to-do lists), Affordable and comfortable journaling tools (e.g., composition notebooks), Personalized journaling practices (e.g., habit stacking, negative visualization)","Find effective journaling techniques, Overcome barriers to consistent journaling, Choose the right journaling tools (notebooks, pens), Start journaling without feeling overwhelmed, Address personal concerns (e.g., privacy, gender norms), Learn from others' mistakes and experiences, Make journaling enjoyable and sustainable, Use journaling for self-improvement and goal tracking","Consistency, Habit formation, Emotional support, Self-discovery, Inspiration, Beginner tips, Notebook preferences, Privacy, Affordability, Gender and journaling, Journaling rituals, Negative visualization, Habit stacking",0.9,

m589hm0,"Wow, I’ve just stumbled onto the mother of all journaling forums.  My first experience in journaling was when I was working as a desk clerk at a Military Police desk. One of my duties was to write up reports and then type them into what we called the blotter. Police blotters are a chronological sequence of events, and the one I did was a record of incidents that Military Police were involved in such as traffic accidents, assaults, robberies and the like.  If someone was on leave in a faraway place and was involved in a crime, was injured or whaever, I would get a phone call, record the details and then type up the report in the blotter. The blotter served as the first report of an incident that later would be recorded by agencies involved in the incident such as emergency medical personnel and other clerical staff who maintained records. What this work did was teach me how to write. These skills served me well when I was at the university studying liberal arts and writing papers.

Later I would keep a personal journal or diary — but never sustained the effort for long.  I did read a lot in my 20’s, and I remember historians describing how popular it was for people to keep journals in the 19th and early 20 centuries.  These were often detailed accounts that included weather data and other observations.

With a rekindled interest in fountain pens, I now am journaling again. At first mostly as an excuse to use the pens, and to comment on the experience of using a fountain pen in terms of how it writes: is it a smooth writer, is it toothsome (scratchy) as in the case of fine or extra fine or extra extra fine point nibs. How juicy (ink flow) is it, is there a lot of line variation — different widths of strokes — and other variables. Flexible nibs allow line variation, and are more common with vintage pens than modern ones.

I have a dozen or so pens inked up and eady to write, and my style of journaling is to make entries in multiple sessions throughout the day and with different pens. The pen I choose to write with will be matched as best as I can to my state of mind—whether I’m feeling carefree in which case I would choose a very smooth writer that glides across the page, or analytical which would make me use a pen with a nib that allows me to write with more precision and accuracy, and so on.  Many stylophiles chose an ink to complement the pen’s color, but contrasting colors are possible also.  Some ink makers date back over 400 years.

Another type of journal I would keep was when I was an amateur radio operator, and would speak or more often than not, send morse code to distant stations. At the end of a series of transmissions, I would record the contact and include whatever interesting details about the person. I remember once being in the middle of a transmission with a Japanesse amateur, and suddenly felt one of my parrots inside my shirt crawling up my back, and sent the morse to my contact about the bird.  The next time we had a contact he asked me about the parrot. Like many amateurs, I would keep accurate and detailed entries  which I later typed \[mea culpa\] into a database so when I met that person again on the air, I could do a quick search of his or her callsign to refresh my memory of what we last talked about.",quiddam,2025-01-04 03:16:39,6,https://reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/1fhr2y4/megathread_getting_started_with_journaling/m589hm0/,journaling,t3_1fhr2y4,False,[Megathread] Getting Started with Journaling!,8b6c44762679ee096619fc6f283d14e46d0bf05b8c28f441b81de2c664831f87,f9535a4a27c421c2e0efc4c1aa1f999e2d5839b7f0ce19ecb868df08082773cc,Y,"Inability to sustain long-term journaling habits, Difficulty in maintaining detailed and accurate entries over time, Challenges in organizing and retrieving past journal entries efficiently","Improved writing skills through structured reporting, Enhanced personal reflection and memory recall through journaling, Enjoyment and motivation derived from using fountain pens and inks, Ability to match journaling tools (pens) to emotional states for a better experience, Detailed record-keeping for hobbies (e.g., amateur radio)","Develop a sustainable journaling habit, Record and reflect on daily experiences and emotions, Organize and retrieve past journal entries efficiently, Enhance the journaling experience with personalized tools (e.g., pens, inks), Maintain detailed records for hobbies and professional purposes","Journaling habits, Writing skills, Fountain pens, Personal reflection, Hobby record-keeping, Emotional state matching, Historical journaling, Organization and retrieval",0.7,"Chronological Event Logging: AI-powered chronological logging similar to a police blotter, allowing users to record events in sequence with timestamps.

miuadgy,"I’ve been journaling for more than 20 years, and at this point, it’s as essential as breathing. If I stop, I lose my clarity, my creativity, and my connection to myself.

In the beginning, my journaling was messy. I scribbled on whatever I could find—napkins, receipts, scraps of paper under my bed. It was a lifeline, a way to process emotions I was too afraid to say out loud. But for years, it had no real direction. I poured everything out, but I wasn’t always getting anything back.

That changed when I started treating journaling as a tool for building my life, not just dumping my thoughts. Here’s what actually works:
	•	Morning pages – Three pages, by hand, first thing in the morning. No stopping, no censoring, just writing until the noise clears and something real starts to show up. (The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron is where I first learned this.)
	•	Start with a question – If I don’t, I end up writing the same stories on repeat. Now, I begin with something I actually want to understand—a frustration I can’t shake, a longing I don’t fully get, a truth I know is there but haven’t been able to name.
	•	Don’t journal in a vacuum – The page is powerful, but transformation happens when I take what I write and talk about it with people I trust. Some things need to be said out loud to become real.

Journaling isn’t just a place to vent. It’s a conversation with the part of you that knows. And when you let it, that voice will tell you exactly what you need to hear.",Big-Application-3766,2025-03-21 02:42:18,3,https://reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/1fhr2y4/megathread_getting_started_with_journaling/miuadgy/,journaling,t3_1fhr2y4,False,[Megathread] Getting Started with Journaling!,8b6c44762679ee096619fc6f283d14e46d0bf05b8c28f441b81de2c664831f87,1cc5979f7b6af21bc2fc306240523a75d69366577d006edabba9dad258e2cc21,Y,"Messy journaling with no direction, Writing the same stories repeatedly without progress, Lack of feedback or actionable insights from journaling, Initial journaling felt like just dumping thoughts without purpose","Clarity, creativity, and self-connection from consistent journaling, Morning pages technique helps clear mental noise and reveal deeper insights, Starting with a question leads to more meaningful and focused journaling, Journaling as a tool for transformation when combined with trusted discussions, Journaling as a conversation with oneself to uncover truths","Process emotions safely and privately, Gain clarity and self-awareness, Break repetitive thought patterns, Transform thoughts into actionable insights, Integrate journaling with trusted social reflection for deeper impact","long-term journaling benefits, morning pages, focused journaling prompts, emotional processing, self-discovery, social integration of journaling, The Artist's Way influence",0.9,"Morning Pages Assistant: AI-powered prompt to encourage daily morning pages with reminders, progress tracking, and a no-distraction writing environment.

mcjfvks,"I used to feel like I was just going through the motions every day, never really reflecting on what mattered most. Then I started journaling—not just writing random thoughts, but following guided prompts that encouraged me to explore my values, emotions, and goals.

Writing these down daily has helped me gain clarity and move forward with intention. If you're new to journaling, I highly recommend using prompts—it makes it easier to get started. I even put together a prompted journal called **""Steps Forward – A Journal for Self-Discovery and Intentional Living""** if anyone’s interested. (Feel free to ask me about it!)

mf9zevx,"Wow, this group is great!! My initial thoughts I would like to share:

1. I have ADHD, PTSD, and high anxiety (among other things) and my family doc recently encouraged me to journal before bed to try to get rid of anxious thoughts and allow me better sleep. I have journaled off and on since I was 15 years old (I'm now 47!). From the notes above I decided to try Day One (I love me some tech and gadgets!) and put it on my MacBook and my iPhone. I am excited to see there are video and audio recording options too! 

2. Having ADHD, I am 100% inconsistent! lol So the past few months I have been giving myself full permission to color completely outside the lines, as it were. I have junk journals (I love the hands-on process...and stickers...and colored pens...) that I work in whenever I have time. And now I will have this digital one specifically for bedtime journaling. And I have a tarot journal! And a day planner covered in stickers and color and notes! And I allow myself to journal without a time line or schedule, and to pick the one that suits me in that moment. The only thing I do every time, across the board, is date my entries for sure. Even the junk journal spreads! And I would encourage everyone to allow themselves the same flexibility. There are no ""journal police""!! No one is going to check on your progress or curse you out if you miss a day (or a week...or a month...).

m529vwx,"The most important thing? Do it your way. Some people have a splurge once a month or so, some write a page every day. Doing it 'right' is the biggest barrier to actually getting words down. Just start with one word and see what happens. Try it on a bus or a train as well as in a comfy chair somewhere cosy. Try it at different times of day - lunchtime is a very overlooked and easy opportunity. Use your phone, your laptop, the back of an envelope. The important thing is externalising the internal. That's the most valuable part of journaling, not the vessel it's in and what you do with it - just like the value of writing is in the writing, not in the publishing/becoming a best-seller. If you need somewhere to start, write about the rules you think there are and then give yourself permission - written of course - to break them (they don't exist!). Good luck and happy journaling.
